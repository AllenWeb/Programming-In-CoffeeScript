  I solemnly swear to test all of my code.
  I will not test just part of my code, but rather all of it.
  I understand that failure to test my code
  will result in Mark finding me and beating me with my own shoes.
  I do this, not just for me,
  but for all developers who have to work with my code base.
  I also pledge to make other developers take this pledge.
  Should they refuse to take this pledge I will tell Mark
  and he will beat them with their own shoes.
  Viva La Tests!
